											<h3>Merger Fractions</h3>
											<p>The galaxy merger fraction ( fgm) is thus the number of galaxies merging, where a system that
												has already condensed into a single galaxy is counted as two galaxies, divided by the number of
												galaxies in the total sample.However this often results from comparing measured galaxy merger fractions (fgm)
												and merger rates ($\mathfrak{R}$) using different techniques to identify the total number of galaxies
												involved in mergers ($N_{gm}$) at various wavelengths ($\lambda$), as well as at different luminosity
												($M_B$), and stellar mass ($M^∗$) ranges. The observed merger fraction is the number of galaxies determined
												to be a merger by a technique within a given set of

											<h3>Nonparametric Measurements</h3>
											<p>At present, the most common methods for measuring galaxy structure in a nonparametric way
												is through the concentration (C), asymmetry (A), clumpiness (S) (CAS) system. These parameters are designed to capture the major features of the underlying structures
												of these galaxies, but in a way that does not involve assumptions about the underlying form, as is
												done with S´ersic fitting (Section 2.2). These nonparametric parameters are also measurable out to
												high redshifts, making them ideal for deriving galaxy evolution over many epochs, as we discuss in
												Section 4.</p>

										<h3>Intro</h3>
										<p>Do galaxies merge? Does the formation of galaxies rely on merging? The answer to
											the first question is undoubtedly yes. There are undeniable and famous ongoing galaxy
											mergers in the nearby universe, such as the Antennae, as well as accretion of galaxy
											satellites into our own galaxy. Perhaps mergers are rare however, and perhaps the low
											level merging seen in our own galaxy is a minor contributor to its mass and evolution.
											On the other hand, merging may be the dominate method whereby galaxies acquire
											their mass, and this activity may drive the evolution we see in distant galaxies (e.g.,
											Hopkins et al. 2006). It is furthermore possible that galaxy merging is not only the
											driving force behind galaxy formation, but may also induce star formation and black
											hole growth, and has been conjectured to be the link between galaxies and quasars.
											We are just beginning to explore observationally the idea that merging is the dominate
											method whereby galaxies form, and understanding its role in a cosmological context will
											likely be one of the major debates in extragalactic astrophysics in the coming years.
										</p>
										<p>
											Determining the history of galaxy interactions, as opposed to active mergers, is more
											difficult. In some sense, looking for galaxies in pairs (Patton et al. 2002) gives us a
											good idea for the likely interaction history, as close galaxies will be interacting without
											necessarily merging. While some increase in the star formation rate is seen for galaxies
											in close pairs (e.g., Barton et al. 2003), it is not clear what the global role interactions
											play in the increase of stellar mass in galaxies. Recent investigations suggest that the
											merger and interaction history together contribute a large fraction of the star formation
											at z < 1 (Bridge et al. 2006).
										</p>
										<p>
											We are in fact now able to resolve galaxies back to redshifts of z = 8 with imaging from space 
											and more recently with adaptive optics from the ground
										</p>
										<h3>"Merger Fraction"- Quantifying Evolution</h3>
										<p>	
											There are only a few methods for measuring the merger fraction, all of which have their
											limitations and advantages.Note that a major merger throughout this review is a merger in which 
											the ratio of the stellar masses of the progenitors are 1:4 or greater. A minor merger is one with a 
											mass ratio of less than 1:4.
										</p>
										<p>
											One ultimate result of finding these mergers is that it allows us to calculate the merger fraction 
											within a population of galaxies. The basic merger fraction ( fm) is calculated as the number of mergers 
											selected within a given redshift bin and stellar mass limit (or luminosity cut) ( Nm) divided by the 
											total number of galaxies within the same redshift bin and stellar mass selection ( NT). 

										</p>

										<p>
											Furthermore, for structural samples, we calculate the merger fraction as opposed to the galaxy
											merger fraction. The difference is important when comparing with pair studies in which the two
											progenitors can be resolved.The difference between these twois subtle, but important.The merger
											fraction considers a merger as having already happened; the two galaxies that have merged now
											count as a single system. The galaxy merger fraction is the fraction calculated when both of these
											merging galaxies are considered as two separate galaxies, which they were before the final merger.
										</p>

										<h4>I Pair studies</h4>
										<p>
											The oldest and perhaps most straightforward observational
											method is to look for galaxies in pairs (e.g., Lin et al. 2004). However, pair studies require
											spectroscopy of complete samples of field galaxies, and have only successfully been applied
											up to z ∼ 1.4. The pair fraction, and resulting merger fraction based on pairs of similar
											luminosities, increases slightly up to z ∼ 1 (see Bridge et al. 2006).
										</p>

										<h4>II Morphology and Kinematics study</h4>
										<p>
											The other method,
											particularly useful at z > 1, is to look for galaxies that are peculiar in their morphology
											or kinematics, and to use this as a measure of the merger fraction (Conselice et al. 2003;
											Lavery et al. 2004; Papovich et al. 2005; Conselice et al. 2005; Lotz et al. 2006).
										</p>
										<p>
											Visual morphological classifications have been performed on nearly all deep HST imaging
											starting from its earliest days (e.g., Dressler et al. 1994, van den Bergh et al. 1996). This has
											continued with deeper and deeper HST observations, including those that sample the rest-frame
											optical in the near-IR (e.g., Lee et al. 2013, Mortlock et al. 2013). There are, however, some
											limitations to how these classifications can be used at higher redshifts, as it is not clear how the
											apparent morphology of a galaxy changes under the influence of redshift effects as opposed to real
											evolution
										</p>
										<p>
											One automatic method for finding mergers is the CAS approach (Conselice 2003), in which merging galaxies 
											are those with a high asymmetry that is also higher than the value of the clumpiness.The simple condition
											$$ \color{#e44c65}(A > 0.35) \& (A > S) $$
											accounts for a large fraction, but not all, of local galaxies that are mergers. Although the contamination from nonmergers is fairly low
											(at a few percent), the fraction of actualmergers that are identified is roughly 50% (Conselice 2003).
											This is largely due to the fact that galaxies involved in the merger process are only quantitatively
											asymmetric for about a third of the lifetime of the merger.
										</p>
										<h3>The Merger History</h3>
										<p>
											One of the primary, if not the primary, uses of galaxy structure at high redshift at the time ofwriting
											is to measure the merger history of galaxies
										</p>
										<h4>The merger fraction evolution.</h4>
										<p>
											It is measured at high redshift through the criteria described in Section 3.2, and the resulting merger fractions are
											shown in Figure 12 (e.g., Conselice et al. 2008, 2009; Bluck et al. 2012).	
										</p>
										<h4>Galaxy merger rate evolution</h4>
										<p>
											The merger fraction is converted into a galaxy merger rate through the use of the merger
											timescale $\tau_{m}$, which can be derived through simulations or through the decline in the merger 
											fraction at lower redshifts.Using the merger timescale, the merger rate per galaxy is thereby defined 
											by the parameter $\Gamma$ $$\color{#e44c65} \Gamma(M^*, z) = \frac{\tau _m}{f_{gm}}$$.
											The value of $\Gamma$ is in units of gigayears and gives the average amount of time between mergers for a
											galaxy within the given selection property, typically stellarmass, and within a given redshift range.Note that within the definition of  the galaxy merger fraction is used rather than the merger
											fraction.
										</p>
										<p>
											Using the evolution of the galaxy merger rate, per galaxy, $\Gamma$, the number of mergers that occur
											between various redshifts is calculated by integrating the inverse of $\Gamma$ over redshift


											$$\color{#e44c65} N_{\text {merg }}=\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \Gamma^{-1} d t=\int_{z_1}^{z_2} \Gamma^{-1} \frac{t_H}{(1+z)} \frac{d z}{E(z)} . $$
										</p>
										<h4>Galaxy Mass Acretion Rate</h4>
										<p>
											Although the number of mergers is an interesting and fundamental quantity, we are ultimately
											interested in the amount of stellar mass added from mergers to galaxies over time. The total
											amount of stellar mass accreted into a galaxy is calculated as a double integral over the redshift
											range of interest (z1 to z2 or lookback times t1 and t2) and over the stellar masses range that is
											being probed (M1 to M2), and can be expressed as
											$$\color{#e44c65} M_{*, M}=\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \int_{M_1}^{M_2} M_* \times \frac{f_m^{\prime}\left(z, M_*\right)}{\tau_{\mathrm{m}}\left(M_*\right)} d M_* d z, $$
