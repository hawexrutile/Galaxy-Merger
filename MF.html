								<h3>Galaxy Merging </h3>
								<p>
									that galaxy merging is not only the
									driving force behind galaxy formation, but may also induce star formation and black
									hole growth, and has been conjectured to be the link between galaxies and quasars.
									We are just beginning to explore observationally the idea that merging is the dominate
									method whereby galaxies form, and understanding its role in a cosmological context will
									likely be one of the major debates in extragalactic astrophysics in the coming years.

								<h3>Fundamental Galaxy Types</h3>
								<div class="row">
									<div class="col-4 col-12-xsmall">

										<h4>Spiral</h4>
										<ul>
											<li>Blue star-forming galaxies</li>
											<li>Spiral galaxies are quite thin, dense, and rotate relatively fast</li>
										</ul>

									</div>
									<div class="col-4 col-12-xsmall">

										<h4>Eliptical</h4>
										<ul>
											<li>Red star-forming galaxies</li>
											<li>Stars in elliptical galaxies have randomly oriented orbits.</li>
										</ul>
									</div>
								</div>
								<h3>Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) </h3>
								<p>
									The majority of giant galaxies contain a supermassive black hole in their centers, ranging in mass from millions
									to billions of times the mass of our Sun. The black hole mass is tied to the host galaxy bulge or spheroid mass.
								</p>
								<h3>Galaxy Formation, The Beginning </h3>
								<p>
									The study of galaxy formation and evolution is concerned with the processes that formed a heterogeneous universe 
									from a homogeneous beginning, the formation of the first galaxies, the way galaxies change over time, and the 
									processes that have generated the variety of structures observed in nearby galaxies. Galaxy formation is 
									hypothesized to occur from structure formation theories, as a result of tiny quantum fluctuations in the aftermath 
									of the Big Bang.The simplest model in general agreement with observed phenomena is the Lambda-CDM modelâ€”that is, 
									that clustering and merging allows galaxies to accumulate mass, determining both their shape and structure.
								</p>
								<p>
									The earliest stage in the evolution of galaxies is their formation. When a galaxy forms, it has a 
									disk shape and is called a spiral galaxy due to spiral-like "arm" structures located on the disk. 
									There are different theories on how these disk-like distributions of stars develop from a cloud of 
									matter: however, at present, none of them exactly predicts the results of observation.
								</p>
								<h3>Disk Galaxy formation theories</h3>
								<div class="row">
									<div class="col-6 col-12-xsmall">

										<h4>Top-down theories</h4>
										<p>
											Olin Eggen, Donald Lynden-Bell, and Allan Sandage in 1962, proposed a theory that disk galaxies form 
											through a monolithic collapse of a large gas cloud. The distribution of matter in the early universe 
											was in clumps that consisted mostly of dark matter. 
										</p>

									</div>
									<div class="col-6 col-12-xsmall">

										<h4>Bottom-up theory</h4>
										<p>
											More recent theories include the clustering of dark matter halos in the bottom-up process. 
										</p>

								<h3>Elyptical Galaxies, The most Evolved Form?</h3>
								<p>
									<span class="image left"><img src="images/MiceGMerger.jpg" alt="" /></span>Elliptical galaxies (most notably supergiant ellipticals, 
									such as ESO 306-17) are among some of the largest known thus far. Their stars are on orbits that are randomly oriented within 
									the galaxy (i.e. they are not rotating like disk galaxies). A distinguishing feature of elliptical galaxies is that the velocity 
									of the stars does not necessarily contribute to flattening of the galaxy, such as in spiral galaxies. Elliptical galaxies have 
									central supermassive black holes, and the masses of these black holes correlate with the galaxy's mass.
								</p>
								<p>
									<span class="image right"><img src="images/antenag.jpg" alt="" /></span>Elliptical galaxies have two main stages of evolution. The 
									first is due to the supermassive black hole growing by accreting cooling gas. The second stage is marked by the black hole 
									stabilizing by suppressing gas cooling, thus leaving the elliptical galaxy in a stable state. The mass of the black hole is also 
									correlated to a property called sigma which is the dispersion of the velocities of stars in their orbits. This relationship, 
									known as the M-sigma relation, was discovered in 2000. Elliptical galaxies mostly lack disks, although some bulges of disk galaxies 
									resemble elliptical galaxies. Elliptical galaxies are more likely found in crowded regions of the universe (such as galaxy clusters).
