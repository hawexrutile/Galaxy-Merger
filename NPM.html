								<h3>CAS parameters </h3>
								<div class="container">
								<p>
									The CAS (concentration, asymmetry, smoothness) parameters are a tool originally developed in astronomy to 
									characterize the shapes and images of objects with some central concentration. Each parameter is a single 
									number which represents some aspect of the structure of the object under study. These parameters were originally 
									developed by astronomers to quantify the light distribution of galaxies, as a way to avoid having to use visual 
									estimates of galaxy morphological classification. They have also been used in biological imaging, and other areas
									of imaging analysis. Each parameter is measured in a well defined way and within a well defined radius.
								</p>
								
								<h3>Asymmetry (A) </h3>
								<p>
									<span class="image left"><img src="Plots/A.png" alt="" /></span>The asymmetry index is a measure of how symmetric an object is. measure of how asymmetric a galaxy is after rotating along the line-of-sight center axis
									of the galaxy by 180◦. This parameter has been used in astronomy to determine galaxy mergers and its history. 
									The asymmetry is a measure of skewness in terms of the 2-dimensional distribution of light. The basic formula for calculating the asymmetry index (A) is given by:
									$$ \color{#e44c65}  A=\min \left(\frac{\Sigma\left|I_0-I_{180}\right|}{\Sigma\left|I_0\right|}\right)$$
									where $I_{0}$ represents the original galaxy image and $I_{180}$ is the image after rotating it from its center
									by 180◦. The measurement of the asymmetry parameter, however, involves several steps beyond
									this simple measure. This includes carefully dealing with the background noise in the same way
									as is done on the galaxy itself, by using a blank background area ($B_{0}$) and finding the location for
									the center of rotation.

								</p>
								<h3>Concentration (C)</h3>
								<p>
									<span class="image right"><img src="Plots/C.png" alt="" /></span>The concentration of light quantifies howmuch 
									light is in the center of a galaxy as opposed to its outer parts.It is an  
									analog of the mean for a spatial distribution in two dimensions. There are many ways of measuring the concentration, including taking ratios of radii
									that contain a certain fraction of light as well as measuring the ratio of the amount of light at two
									given radii.These radii are often defined by the total amount of light measured within some Petrosian radius, often at the same location as used
									for measuring the asymmetry index.The ratio most commonly used is that of two circular radii that contain an inner and outer
									fraction of the total galaxy flux,
									$$\color{#e44c65}C=5 \times \log \left(\frac{r_{\text {outer }}}{r_{\text {inner }}}\right)\color{#e44c65}$$
									A higher value of C indicates that a larger amount of light in a galaxy is contained within a central region.
									
								</p>
								
								<h3>Smoothness (S)</h3>
								<p>
									<span class="image left"><img src="Plots/S.png" alt="" /></span>The smoothness (also called clumpiness) is a measure of the fraction of light in an object which is in small scale 
									structures. It is an analog of the standard deviation for a 2-dimensional image. Clumpy galaxies have a relatively large
									amount of light at high spatial frequencies, whereas smooth systems, such as elliptical galaxies, contain light at low 
									spatial frequencies.Clumpiness can be measured in a number of ways; the most common method used IS:
									$$ \color{#e44c65}S=10 \times \left(\frac{\Sigma\left(I_{x, y}-I_{x, y}^\sigma\right)}{\Sigma I_{x, y}}\right) $$
									where the original image, $I_{x,y}$ , is blurred to produce a secondary image, $I^σ_{x,y}$. This
									blurred image is then subtracted from the original image, leaving a residual map containing only
									high-frequency structures in the galaxy. The size of the smoothing kernel σ is
									determined by the radius of the galaxy. Note that the centers of galaxies are removed when
									this procedure is carried out as they often contain unresolved high spatial frequency light.

								<h3>Gini/M20 parameters</h3>
								<p>
									<span class="image left"><img src="images/MiceGMerger.jpg" alt="" /></span>Elliptical galaxies (most notably supergiant ellipticals, 
									such as ESO 306-17) are among some of the largest known thus far. Their stars are on orbits that are randomly oriented within 
									the galaxy (i.e. they are not rotating like disk galaxies). A distinguishing feature of elliptical galaxies is that the velocity 
									of the stars does not necessarily contribute to flattening of the galaxy, such as in spiral galaxies. Elliptical galaxies have 
									central supermassive black holes, and the masses of these black holes correlate with the galaxy's mass.
								</p>
								<p>
									<span class="image right"><img src="images/antenag.jpg" alt="" /></span>Elliptical galaxies have two main stages of evolution. The 
									first is due to the supermassive black hole growing by accreting cooling gas. The second stage is marked by the black hole 
									stabilizing by suppressing gas cooling, thus leaving the elliptical galaxy in a stable state. The mass of the black hole is also 
									correlated to a property called sigma which is the dispersion of the velocities of stars in their orbits. This relationship, 
									known as the M-sigma relation, was discovered in 2000. Elliptical galaxies mostly lack disks, although some bulges of disk galaxies 
									resemble elliptical galaxies. Elliptical galaxies are more likely found in crowded regions of the universe (such as galaxy clusters).
