								<h3>Galaxy Merging </h3>
								<p>
									<span class="image right"><img src="images/antenag.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									It is senseless to doubt the exsistense of mergers in our universe as there are undeniable and famous ongoing galaxy
									mergers in the nearby universe, such as the Antennae. Mergers might be uncommon, however, merging may be the primary 
									process by which galaxies gain mass, and this activity may be responsible for the evolution we observe in distant galaxies.
								</p>
								<p>Galaxy mergers have been hypothesised to:</p>
								<ul>
									<li> Stimulate star formation</li>
									<li> Black hole expansion,</li>
									<li> Formation of quasars</li>
									<li> and the primary cause of galaxy formation</li>
								</ul>
									The cold dark matter model, which is widely accepted as the most plausible explanation for how 
									galaxies evolve over cosmic time, predicts the existence of merges.
									<a href="https://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/1978MNRAS.183..341W">(White & Rees 1978)</a>.
									Understanding the function of merging in a cosmic context will probably be one of the major disputes in extragalactic astrophysics in the future years. We are only beginning to study observationally the hypothesis that merging is the dominant technique by which galaxies originate.

								<h3>Galaxy Formation, The Beginning </h3>
								<p>
									The origin of galaxy formation is hypothesized to occur due to tiny quantum fluctuations in the aftermath of the Big Bang. 
									These fluctuations result clumping of matter in the early universe which followed by clustering and merging, allowed galaxies to accumulate mass, determining their shape and structure.
								</p>
								<p>
									When galaxies first develop, they typically have a disc shape and are known as spiral galaxies because of the spiral-like "arm" patterns that are found on the disc. There are two main ideas explaining how these star distributions in discs form from clouds of stuff.
								</p>
								<h3>Disk Galaxy formation theories</h3>
								<div class="row">
									<div class="col-6 col-12-xsmall">

										<h4>Top-down theories</h4>
										<p>
											A significant gas cloud monolithically collapses to produce disc galaxies. In the early cosmos, dark matter predominated in the clumps that made up the dispersion of matter. These clumps gravitationally interacted, creating tidal torques that gave them some angular momentum. Then, matter coalesces into a tight disc that cools and fragments into smaller clouds of gas that eventually become stars. The dark matter is still dispersed outside the disc in the so-called dark halo.
										</p>
										<p>This theory is quite simple yet no longer widely accepted.</p>

									</div>
									<div class="col-6 col-12-xsmall">

										<h4>Bottom-up theory</h4>
										<p>
											These "smaller" clumps of matter, with masses on the scale of globular clusters, Â combined to create galaxies, which were then drawn together by gravitation to form galaxy clusters. This type of mechanism leads to models anticipating more small galaxies than massive ones, which is consistent with data.
											Astronomers are now unsure of what mechanism prevents the contraction.
										</p>
										<p>
											Astronomers do not currently know what process stops the contraction.

								<h3>Elyptical Galaxies, The most Evolved Form?</h3>
								<p>
									<span class="image left"><img src="images/elip.png" alt="" /></span>
									The giant galaxies discovered so far include elliptical ones. They are now acknowledged as some of the universe's most advanced systems. Supermassive black holes are found in the centers of elliptical galaxies, and the masses of these black holes are correlated with the galaxy's mass.
									
								</p>

								<p>
									It is generally acknowledged that the merging of smaller galaxies is the primary factor influencing the evolution of elliptical galaxies. The resulting galaxy will be elliptical if the two galaxies are similar in size. There are numerous varieties of galaxy mergers, which alter the structure of the galaxy but may not always produce elliptical galaxies.
								</p>

								<h3>Galaxy quenching, The End?</h3>
								<p>
									The current rate of galaxy mergers cannot explain Star formation slowing in galaxies.
									Therefore, the mechanism by which star production stops in galaxies must be describable by theories. This phenomenon is known as galactic "quenching."
								</p>
								<p>
									When a galaxy runs out of cool gas for star formation, it is said to be quenched. Though quenching is predicted to happen relatively fast (about 1 billion years), it would take far longer for a galaxy to exhaust its supply of cool gas.
									Models of galaxy evolution explain this by speculating on a different physical processes that eliminate or interrupt a galaxy's supply of cool gas. These mechanisms can be divided broadly into two groups:
									<ol>
										<li>Preventive feedback mechanisms that stop cold gas from entering a galaxy or stop it from producing stars</li>
										<li>Ejective feedback mechanisms that remove gas so that it cannot form stars.</li>
									</ol>
